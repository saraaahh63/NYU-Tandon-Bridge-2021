### Section 1: Computer Systems (Pg. 2-33)

The computer has five main components:
* Input Device(s)
* Output Device(s)
* Processor (Central Processing Unit / CPU)
* Main Memory (Random Access Memory / RAM)
* Secondary Memory

**Input Device:** Any device that allows a person to communicate information to the computer.

**Output Device:** Anything that allows the computer to communicate information to you.

Binary Digit / Bit: A digit that can assume only the values 0 or 1. (8 bits = 1 byte)

**Main Memory:** A long list of memory locations (of varying sizes) expressed in bytes. The contents of these locations can change. Hence, you can think of each memory location as a tiny blackboard on which the computer can write and erase.

The memory locations in most computers contain eight bits (or some multiple of eight bits).

**Bytes and Addresses:** Main memory is divided into numbered locations called bytes. The number associated with a byte is called its address. A group of consecutive bytes is used as the location for a data item, such as a number or letter. The address of the first byte in the group is used as the address of this larger memory location.

**Secondary Memory:** Memory that is used for keeping a permanent record of information after (and before) the computer is used, like hard disks.

Main memory is often referred to as RAM or random access memory. It is called random access because the computer can immediately access the data in any memory location. secondary memory often requires sequential access,which means that the computer must look through all (or at least very many) memory locations until it finds the item it needs.

**Processor:** The "brain" of the computer. The processor follows the instructions in a program and performs the  calculations specified by the program.
